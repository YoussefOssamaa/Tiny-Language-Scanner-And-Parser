# Tiny-Language-Scanner
  The Scanner Project involves building a lexical analyzer for the TINY language. It processes TINY code as input and outputs a file containing a list of (token value, token type) pairs.   The scanner must identify tokens like keywords (IF, THEN, READ, etc.), special symbols (:=, &lt;, +, -, (, )), Identifiers (e.g., x), and Numbers (e.g., 12).
